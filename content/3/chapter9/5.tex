In this chapter, we learned how to write an LLVM Pass for the new PassManager and how to use program analysis data within a Pass via the AnalysisManager. We also learned how to leverage various instrumentation tools to improve the development experiences while working with the Pass pipeline. With the skills gained from this chapter, you can now write a Pass to process LLVM IR, which can be used to transform or even optimize a program.

These topics are some of the most fundamental and crucial skills to learn before starting on any IR level transformation or analysis task. If you have been working with the legacy PassManager, these skills can also help you to migrate your code to the new PassManager system, which has now been enabled by default. 

In the next chapter, we will show you various tips along with the best practices that you should know when using the APIs of LLVM IR.
