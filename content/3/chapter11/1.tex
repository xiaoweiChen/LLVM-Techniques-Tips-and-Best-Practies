In this section, we are also going to use LLVM Pass as the platform to show different API usages. Therefore, please make sure you have built the opt command-line tool, as follows:

\begin{tcblisting}{commandshell={}}
$ ninja opt
\end{tcblisting}

Note that some of the content in this chapter only works with a debug build version of LLVM. Please check the first chapter, Chapter 1, Saving Resources When Building LLVM, for a recap on how to build LLVM in debug mode.

You can also go back to Chapter 9, Working with PassManager and AnalysisManager, if you are not sure how to create a new LLVM Pass.
