This chapter focuses on one tool in the utils folder: llvm-tblgen. To build it, launch the following command:

\begin{tcblisting}{commandshell={}}
$ ninja llvm-tblgen
\end{tcblisting}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!5!white,colframe=blue!75!black, fonttitle=\bfseries,title=Note]
\hspace*{0.7cm}If you chose to build llvm-tblgen in Release mode regardless of the global build type, using the LLVM\_OPTIMIZED\_TABLEGEN CMake variable introduced in the first chapter, you might want to change that setting since it's always better to have a debug version of llvm-tblgen in this chapter.
\end{tcolorbox}
