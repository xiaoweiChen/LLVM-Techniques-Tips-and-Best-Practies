Similar to Chapter 1, Saving Resources When Building LLVM, you might want to have a copy of LLVM built from its source. Optionally, since this chapter will touch on quite a lot of CMake build files, you may wish to prepare a syntax highlighting plugin for CMakeLists.txt (for example, VSCode's CMake Tools plugin). All major IDEs and editors should have it off-the-shelf. Also, familiarity with basic CMakeLists.txt syntax is preferable.

All the code examples in this chapter can be found in this book's GitHub repository: \url{https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLVM-Techniques-Tips-and-Best-Practices/tree/main/Chapter02}.
