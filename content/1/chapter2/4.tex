This chapter dug deeper into LLVM's CMake build system. We saw how to use LLVM's own CMake directives to write concise and effective build scripts, for both in-tree and out-of-tree development. Learning these CMake skills can make your LLVM development more efficient and provide you with more options to engage LLVM features with other existing code bases or custom logic.

In the next chapter, we will introduce another important infrastructure in the LLVM project known as the LLVM LIT, which is an easy-to-use yet general framework for running various kinds of tests.
